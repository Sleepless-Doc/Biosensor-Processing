Biosensor data processing

Here is a toy version of the software created for the data.
The Toy_dataset.mat file contains a sample dataset with 35 samples (30 for training, 5 for testing) from the experimental data used in this study.

The Prep_data.m file is the MatLab function that preprocessed the data.
The get_network.m file is the MatLab function used to train the LSTM network. 
The Biosensor_LSTM_TB.m file is a script showing how the functions are used.
